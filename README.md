This project is a NestJS API that consumes a NestJS Websocket Server. Be sure to clone the NestJS Websocket Gateway example [here](https://github.com/stuyy/nestjs-websocket-gateway-example) and run both projects.

You can also find a React project that connects to the NestJS Socket Server [here](https://github.com/stuyy/nestjs-react-socket-client).
